# Project: Rock, paper, scissors
This project is based on The Odin project resource, Foundations part. 

The project idea and the goal was to learn/use Javascript to create rock, paper, scissors game. 
Initial game was made at the console level using prompt() and alert(). 

Once enough material was covered in the course, it asked to make UI for the game. 

Refreshed knowledge on:
* Basic CLI
* HTML tags, linking to files
* CSS basics, flexbox, media queries, simple animation

Learned something new on:
* git branching and merging (basics)
* Javascript syntax
* fundamental programming principles
* DOM manipulation
